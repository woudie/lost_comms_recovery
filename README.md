# lost_comms_recovery

If your robot loses connection to the base station it will navigate to a configurable home.

*NOTE*: This package was orginally created by daniel snider of R3, but I have modified to simplified use to simply ensure safe robot usage on network lose. I am in no way claiming this to be my work, I simply modified for my purpose as allowed by the liscense.

## Quick Start

1. Launch node:

```
$ roslaunch lost_comms_recovery lost_comms_recovery.launch
```
